# AoseDevKit2018

The AoseDevKit2018 framework has been implemented for the course of Agent Oriented Software Engineering at the University Of Trento (2018).
The framework consists of three repositories:
- *AoseDevKit2018-MultiAgentSystem: https://github.com/marcorobol/AoseDevKit2018-MultiAgentSystem*
- *AoseDevKit2018-Generic: https://github.com/marcorobol/AoseDevKit2018-Generic*
- *AoseDevKit2018-Blocksworld: https://github.com/marcorobol/AoseDevKit2018-Blocksworld*

Introductory slides on the framework are available in the doc folder in the AoseDevKit2018-MultiAgentSystem repository.

In the case of bugs to any of these, let us know or fix them and do a pull request.
